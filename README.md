# sketchbook-js
Sketchbook of codes written in javascript (algorithms, 2D and 3D).

This repo is a dump of my coding sketchbook: some programming explorations in javascript, filled with additional notes.  
Most of the codes are written from scratch with no dependencies (when it's possible), with the intention to learn.
